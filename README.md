# Gomoku AI Game

A Python-based implementation of the classic Gomoku (Five in a Row) game with an AI opponent. This project uses the Pygame library for graphical visualization and provides a fun way to play and practice the game with an intelligent bot.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play as either black or white stones on a 15x15 board.
- **AI Opponent**: Intelligent bot utilizing custom evaluation algorithms for challenging gameplay.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Powered by Pygame for a smooth gaming experience.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects the winner and declares game over.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- Random library for move generation

## How It Works

1. The player clicks on the board to place their piece.
2. The AI calculates its next move using a heuristic-based evaluation function.
3. The game ends when a player aligns 4 pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.
